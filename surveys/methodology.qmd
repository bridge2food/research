This page outlines methodology details and explains key differences from the EU Business and Consumer Surveys. For questions and additional clarifications, please email communication@bridge2food.com.

# Aggregation

EU Business and Consumer Surveys provide industry data and composite indicators at the NACE Rev. 2.1 two-digit level, for which Division 10 represents the manufacture of food products. At the three-digit level, Group 10.1 represents the production of meat products, while Group 10.5 represents the manufacture of dairy products. At the four-digit level of the NACE taxonomy, plant-based meat and milk substitutes fall under Class 10.89, which broadly represents the manufacture of other food products not elsewhere classified.

While the BCS surveys do not provide disaggregated data for Groups 10.1 and 10.5, there are a number of economic indicators available to monitor the status of these sectors, such as producer and consumer prices, and livestock and dairy futures, among others. In contrast, there are no such figures available for the plant-derived analogs of those sectors.

B2F surveys provide data for the plant-based meat and dairy substitute sectors that are directly comparable to BCS figures for the overall food industry. These data also serve to benchmark the plant protein sector over time and against other food and technology segments.

# Frequency

BCS industry surveys are conducted monthly, with different questionnaires sent out on a quarterly basis. B2F surveys combine questions from the BCS monthly and quarterly industry surveys into a single quarterly questionnaire. Additionally, both BCS and B2F industry surveys include additional questions in Q2 and Q4 regarding yearly expectations and experience.

# Geography

BCS surveys are focused exclusively on the European regional economy. B2F industry surveys are not geographically limited and include respondents from all continents and regions.

# Seasonal Adjustment

Typically, data must be collected for at least three years before applying seasonal adjustments. BCS industry survey data are available as both seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted figures. B2F industry survey data are currently available only as non-seasonally adjusted.

# Language & Phrasing

BCS industry surveys are conducted in languages of the respondent countries. B2F industry surveys are conducted only in English. While the core content of each question remains harmonized with BCS survey questions, the phrasing of B2F questions vary slightly, as those provided in BCS example questionnaires are designed for telephone interview rather than for written presentation in web-based survey software.

# Questionnaires

BCS industry surveys include questions on domestic and export orders. As B2F industry surveys are not geographically limited, these questions are excluded. Instead, B2F surveys include questions about geographic sales distributions.

# Data Collection Methodology

Some BCS industry data is collected by telephone interview. B2F survey data is collected through online questionnaires using the survey software Qualtrics.

# Pre-Market Segments

In addition to industry surveys of the plant protein sector, the methodologies for which closely align with EU Business and Consumer Surveys, B2F conducts surveys of emerging protein technology sectors, investors, and industry analysts. These surveys are also designed to provide macro-level insight into their fields, however, they focus more on R&D activities and sentiment rather than on standard market indicators.
