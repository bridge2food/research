This is how beer, wine, yogurt, and cheese are made. Traditional fermentation is used e.g. to improve the flavor or functionality of plant ingredients.\nBiomass Fermentation is utilized within food industry to grow protein-rich microorganisms. These microorganisms are used as ingredients for plant-based alternative proteins. Alternative proteins are aimed to replace milk, meat, or fish as protein source. For example, filamentous fungi grown via fermentation can be used as the primary ingredient of alternative protein.\nPrecision Fermentation uses microorganisms to produce specific functional ingredients. The microorganisms are programmed to be little production factories. This is how insulin for diabetic patients is produced, as well as rennet for cheese production. Precision fermentation enables alternative protein producers to efficiently make specific proteins, enzymes, flavor molecules, vitamins, pigments, and fats."

    "text": "Row\nHealthFerm is the EU-funded research project investigating innovative pulse and cereal-based food fermentations together with the health effects and consumer perception of novel fermented foods. Work Package 4 “Consumer Studies” has the following objectives:\n\nTo identify levers to promote the consumption of foods & meals based on plant-based fermentations.\nTo assess and monitor the changes in consumer perceptions towards plant-based fermented foods in 9 EU countries.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, two cross-sectional surveys are planned, aiming to explore consumer perceptions of plant-based fermented foods (PBFF). For this purpose, HealthFerm set up a questionnaire that addressed attitudes, trust, behaviour, and market opportunities for fermented plant-based foods. The questionnaire included socio-demographic information that will allow for segmenting and statistical modelling.\nThis report is based on the first wave that took place between December 2023 and February 2024 across BE, CH, DE, DK, FI, FR, IT, RO, SE. The questionnaire covered sociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, locality of residence, education level, financial situation, and dietary habits), to ensure representativeness, sufficient statistical power, and to further control for known confounding.\nThe survey was completed by respondents who were recruited by Enkettfabriken, with a total of 7,812 participants over the age of 18 and at least 750 respondents per country, equally divided amongst females/males (50% each), and within five age groups: 18-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60 and 60+ (approx. 20% in each).\nParticipants provided information about their eating habits, although only self-identified flexitarians and omnivores were asked about their consumption of meat, and their intentions towards reducing or increasing their currents consumption levels."
